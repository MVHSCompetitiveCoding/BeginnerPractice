#Welcome to Competitive Programming!
This guide is intended as a starting point for new programmers.
We are excited to have you as a new member of the team, but for
you to have any fun, its probably best that you learn how to program.
Here is a list of languages you can learn, and our thoughts about each
one.

##Python

####Pros
* Probably one of the best scripting languages ever made
* Very easy to learn, most people can read simple python programs and work out what it is that they do
* Widely used, even the varsity team uses python for almost all of its competition solutions
* Powerful and high level (lots of functionality)
* Can be both object oriented and non-object oriented

####Cons
* Very slow during execution
* Can not use many low level API's and SDK's available in other languages
* Python2 and Python3 are not consistent with syntax

####Tutorials
* [LearnPython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)

####Team Experts
* Daniel Grimshaw
* Zach O'hara
* Pranav Mathur

---------------------------------------------------------

##Java

####Pros
* Reasonably fast
* Fully object oriented
* Reasonably easy to get started in, gets a lot more complex at advanced levels
* Mix of low level capability (the code is close to the actual hardware) and high level functionality

####Cons
* Very few API's were originally written for Java
* Uses more RAM than almost all of these other languages
* Has a reputation as a programming "toy" rather than a language

####Tutorials
* [LearnJavaOnline.org](http://www.learnjavaonline.org/)

####Team Experts
* Pranav Mathur (best)
* Zach O'hara
* Daniel Grimshaw

---------------------------------------------------------

##C/C++

####Pros
* Extremely fast
* Very low level
* Massive ammount of libraries

####Cons
* Extremely hard to learn
* Older language
* Vulnerable to overflow errors, which can kill your computer if used correctly

####Tutorials
* [Learn-C.org](http://www.learn-c.org/)

####Team Experts
* Daniel Grimshaw (best)

---------------------------------------------------------

##JavaScript

####Pros
* Works on websites
* Similar to python in simplicity

####Cons
* It's pretty weird
* None of the captains can help you much with this one
* Lots of bad tutorials on the internet

####Tutorials
* [Learn-JS.org](http://www.learn-js.org/)

####Team Experts
* No one

---------------------------------------------------------

##Shell Scripting

####Pros
* Similar to python
* Capable of running all command line programs easily
* More less automated computer using

####Cons
* Not every computer uses the same language
* Older
* Windows version is awful
* We don't have a Linux computer right now to run these on

####Tutorials
* [LearnShell.org](http://www.learnshell.org/)

####Team Experts
I don't think either of us consider ourselves true experts, but we can try to help:

##C-Sharp

####Pros
* Just like Java, but without restrictions
* C-like syntax
* Compiles into executable for similar speed to C
* Microsoft will employ you with a near certainty if you know C# well

####Cons
* Only runs on Windows computers
* Bulky
* Non-transferable skill, unless you wish to work for Microsoft.

####Tutorials

####Team Experts

##Haskell

####Pros
* Fully functional
* Mathematical syntax
* Compiles into executable for similar speed to C
* Can be compiled or interpreted
* Has an interpreter similar to Python, which can also load source files
* "If it compiles, it probably works"

####Cons
* VERY difficult to learn if coming from an imperative language
* Difficult to install on Windows

####Tutorials
* [LearnYouAHaskell.com](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

####Team Experts
* Pranav Mathur (minimal)

--------------------------------------------------------

##Rust

####Pros
* Just like C, but with less complicated syntax
* C-like syntax for simple code
* Compiles into executable for similar speed to C
* Very fast due to lack of garbage collector

####Cons
* Not widely used

####Tutorials
* [Rust By Example](http://rustbyexample.com/)
