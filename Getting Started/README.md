#Welcome to Competitive Programming!
This guide is intended as a starting point for new programmers.
We are excited to have you as a new member of the team, but for
you to have any fun, its probably best that you learn how to program.
Here is a list of languages you can learn, and our thoughts about each
one.

##Python
####Pros
* Probably one of the best scripting languages ever made
* Very easy to learn, most people can read simple python programs and work out what it is that they do
* Widely used, even the varsity team uses python for almost all of its competition solutions
* Powerful and high level (lots of functionality)
* Can be both object oriented and non-object oriented
####Cons
* Very slow during execution
* Can not use many low level API's and SDK's available in other languages
* Python2 and Python3 are not consistent with syntax

##Java
####Pros
* Reasonably fast
* Fully object oriented
* Reasonably easy to get started in, gets a lot more complex at advanced levels
* Mix of low level capability (the code is close to the actual hardware) and high level functionality
####Cons
* Very few API's were originally written for Java
* Uses more RAM than almost all of these other languages
* Has a reputation as a programming "toy" rather than a language
